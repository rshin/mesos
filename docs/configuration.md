# Mesos Configuration

The Mesos master and slave can take a variety of configuration options through command-line arguments, or environment variables. A list of the available options can be seen by running `mesos-master --help` or `mesos-slave --help`. Each option can be set in two ways:

* By passing it to the binary using `--option_name=value`.
* By setting the environment variable `MESOS_OPTION_NAME` (the option name with a `MESOS_` prefix added to it).

Configuration values are searched for first in the environment, then on the command-line.

**Important Options**

If you have special compilation requirements, please refer to `./configure --help` when configuring Mesos. Additionally, the documentation lists only a subset of the options. A definitive source for which flags your version of Mesos supports can be found by running the binary with the flag `--help`, for example `bin/mesos-master --help`.

## Master and Slave Options

*These options can be supplied to both masters and slaves.*

* `log_dir` : Directory for log files. If unspecified, nothing is written to disk.

* `quiet` : Disable logging to stderr. [Default: false]

* `ip` : IP address to listen on. [Optional]

* `port` : Port to listen on. [Default for master: 5050, Default for slave:5051]

## Master Options

* `zk` : ZooKeeper URL (used for leader election amongst multiple masters). May be one of:
	* zk://host1:port1,host2:port2,.../path
	* zk://username:password@host1:port1,host2:port2,.../path
	* file://path/to/file (where file contains one of the above)

* `roles` : A comma seperated list of the allocation roles
            that frameworks in this cluster may belong to.

* `weights` : A comma seperated list of role/weight pairs
              of the form 'role=weight,role=weight'. Weights
              are used to indicate forms of priority.

## Slave Options

* `resources` : Total consumable resources per slave, in
                  the form 'name(role):value;name(role):value...'.
	* NOTE: '(role)' is optional.
	* Ex: "cpus(role2):2;mem(role2):1024;cpus:1;mem:1024;disk:0"

* `attributes` : Attributes for the machine. [Optional]
	* These are free-form in the same style as resources, ex: "rack:abc;kernel:2.6.44".
	* This information is provided to frameworks.

* `work_dir` : Directory for the executor work directories. [Default: /tmp/mesos]
	* `isolation` : Isolation mechanism, one of: "process", "cgroups". [Default: process]
	* `cgroups_enable_cfs` : If using cgroups isolation, this enables hard limits on CPU resources.

* `master` : May be one of:
	* zk://host1:port1,host2:port2,.../path
	* zk://username:password@host1:port1,host2:port2,.../path\n
	* file://path/to/file (where file contains one of the above)

* `default_role` : Any resources in the --resources flag that
                   omit a role, as well as any resources that
                   are not present in --resources but that are
                   automatically detected, will be assigned to
                   this role. [Default: *]

* `checkpoint` :  Whether to checkpoint slave and frameworks information
                  to disk.
	* This enables a restarted slave to recover status updates and reconnect
    with (--recover=reconnect) or kill (--recover=kill) old executors [Default: false]

* `strict` : Whether to do recovery in strict mode [Default: true].
	* If strict=true, any and all recovery errors are considered fatal.
	* If strict=false, any errors (e.g., corruption in checkpointed data) during recovery are
    ignored and as much state as possible is recovered.

## Mesos Configuration Options

The configure script itself accepts the following arguments to enable various options:

* `--with-python-headers=DIR`: Find Python header files in `DIR` (to turn on Python support). Recommended.
* `--with-webui`: Enable the Mesos web UI (which requires Python 2.6). Recommended.
* `--with-java-home=DIR`: Enable Java application/framework support with a given installation of Java. Required for Hadoop and Spark.
* `--with-java-headers=DIR`: Find Java header files (necessary for newer versions of OS X Snow Leopard).
* `--with-included-zookeeper` or `--with-zookeeper=DIR`: Enable master fault-tolerance using an existing ZooKeeper installation or the version of ZooKeeper bundled with Mesos. For details, see [High Availability](high-availability.md).
